# Iris Dataset Visualization and Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive suite of visualizations and analyses for the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The project includes interactive plots and static visualizations to explore the relationships between different features of the dataset, correlations, and predictions.

## Features

- **Interactive Plots**: Explore relationships between features using engaging plots.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize the correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
- **Pair Plots**: Display pairwise relationships and distributions of each feature with all others.
- **3D Scatter Plots**: Analyze data in three dimensions to uncover patterns.
- **Sunburst Charts**: Visualize hierarchical data structures.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using `pip`: pandas, scikit-learn, plotly.


## Usage

1. **Interactive Plots**:

   - Generates interactive scatter plots to explore relationships between features.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**:

   - Displays a heatmap showing the correlations between different features with predefined color schemes.

3. **Pair Plots**:

   - Creates pairwise scatter plots and histograms to analyze feature interactions.

4. **3D Scatter Plots**:

   - Generates a 3D scatter plot to visualize data in three dimensions.

5. **Sunburst Charts**:

   - Provides a hierarchical view of the data using sunburst charts.
